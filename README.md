## Introduction
Generating talking images with audio is a fascinating application of machine learning and WebRTC technologies. The combination of these cutting-edge tools has made it
possible to create animated characters that can not only display facial expressions but also speak with realistic voices. The process involves using a machine learning
pre-trained model on vast amounts of data, which can then be used to generate realistic facial movements and speech in real-time. WebRTC technology, on the other hand,
enables real-time communication between devices and enables seamless integration of the talking images into web applications. The result is a highly engaging and
interactive experience that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual assistants, customer service chatbots, or even as a fun way to express yourself online.

## Architecture
   
   ### Client-Server Architecture

   The Client-Server model with WebRTC and ML model describes a system where clients use WebRTC technology to establish a real-time, peer-to-peer communication channel with a server. The server hosts a machine learning model that is used to process and analyze data received from the clients. The clients can send data to the server in real-time, and receive results from the ML model, allowing for dynamic and interactive communication between the two components. This setup enables users to receive immediate results from the ML model without the need for a long and slow data transfer process, making it a highly efficient and effective solution for a wide range of applications.
